# TinyChat

An ultra-lightweight chat window function enhancement addon. Provides buttons for switching channels, copying chat content, emoticons, counting down monsters, rolling dice, displaying item levels and icons... and many more features.

Instructions:

Chat enhancement setting options: Right-click the small icon on the leftmost side of the channel button.
Add built-in voice: right-click the small icon on the leftmost side of the channel button.
Move a channel button: Hold down the Alt key and drag the small icon on the far left side of the channel button.
Show/hide social channel buttons: Settings > Show channel buttons > Social channels.
Switch channels: Left-click the channel name above the chat window.
Open/close a channel: Right-click the channel name above the chat window.
Quickly switch channels: Press the Tab key while typing text.
Quickly enter the previous content: press the up/down arrow keys (or Alt+up/down arrow keys, which can be set in the menu) when entering text.
Quickly scroll to top/bottom: Hold down Ctrl and roll the mouse wheel.
Enter emoji: Enter { while typing to display the emoji menu.
Countdown for opening monsters: left-clicking 'Open' will start the countdown, right-clicking 'Open' will cancel the countdown.

Countdown time for starting monsters and shouting: Right-click the small icon on the far left of the channel button > Countdown for starting monsters.

Filter chat delays: Avoid seeing chat messages that are delayed due to large server lag (off by default).

The Talk and Shout channel is automatically closed when you leave the dungeon, and the channel will be opened automatically when entering the dungeon.
Automatically close the speech bubble when entering a dungeon. Delayed speech bubbles are no longer useful and only block the screen.
At the same time, system frequency washing messages that you are not in the team/team will also be filtered out.
9-12pm timer switch: By default, the call delay filtering function will be automatically turned on from 9-12pm, and will be automatically turned off at other times. If you want to manually toggle call delay filtering on and off, disable this option.

Speech Bubble: Convenient to manually open and close the speech bubble.

Special note, if you turn on the 9-12pm timer switch (or turn it on manually) to delay the speech filtering function, the dialogue bubble will be closed inside and outside the copy, and the dialogue bubble will not be opened automatically.

This is a special version of Rainbow UI.
